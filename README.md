# ChurnRate_Prediction

## Project Overview 
This project was my first attempt into diving into machine learning by predicting customer churn rates using real world data. Through this project I got hands on experience with Python libraies like scikit-learn for building predictive models and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application. 

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Requires python 3.8+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

Start the Streamlit server:
```bash
streamlit run app.py to get a website
```

Stop the Streamlit server:
```bash
^C # Control C
```
